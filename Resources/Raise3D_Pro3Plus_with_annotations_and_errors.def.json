        # Cura uses this to create a collision area around the objects you're printing in one-at-a-time mode. This collision area prevents you from placing objects too close to one another such that they can't be printed without the print head hitting the previously printed model. The collision area is not the same shape as the print head itself though: It will be a convex hull around the print head to prevent collisions during travel moves as well. It will also be shrunk to be symmetric. For instance, if the nozzle is more towards the left side of the print head (as in the above picture) then the collision area will be shrunk such that another object may be placed close to the right side of previously printed objects. The order in which these objects are printed will then be adjusted so that they can be printed without collisions.
